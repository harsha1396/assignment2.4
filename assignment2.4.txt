1)Impotance of NameNode in Hadoop Cluster:
NameNode is the central part of  HDFS and it is also referred to as the Master. 
It only stores the metadata of HDFS that is the directory tree of all files in the file system and it also tracks the files across the cluster.
It does not store the actual data or the dataset but the data itself is actually stored in the DataNodes.
It also knows the list of the blocks and its location for any file in HDFS and with the help of this,NameNode constructs the file from blocks.
It is so critical to HDFS and when the NameNode is down and it is a single point failure in Hadoop cluster.
It is usually configured with a lot of memory (RAM) because the block locations help in main memory.
